# 1.1. Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting

In the previous example our goal is to predict the value of t for some new value of x, without knowledge of the green curve.

Let's start by introducing a simple regression problem

We have a training set comprising of N observations of $$x $$ written as $$\mathbf{x} \equiv\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N}\right)^{T},$$ with corresponding target values t, denoted as $$\mathbf{t} \equiv\left(t_{1}, \ldots, t_{N}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$$.

Our goal is to exploit this training set in order to make predictions predictions $$\widehat{t}$$ for some new value $$\widehat{x}$$ of the input variable.
