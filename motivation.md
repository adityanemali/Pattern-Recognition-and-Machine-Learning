# Motivation

Consider an example of recognizing hand written digits illustrated below

![Figure 1.1](.gitbook/assets/1_pzjkotfrjpqca4trbqqcaq.png)

* Each digit corresponds to a 28\*28 pixel image 

![](.gitbook/assets/1_clstcwtul1gybuv8vnboxw%20%281%29.jpeg)

* A image an represented by a vector $$x$$ comprising 784 real numbers

**GOAL :** 

To build a machine that will take a vector $$x $$ \( ![](.gitbook/assets/1_clstcwtul1gybuv8vnboxw.jpeg) \) as input and produce an output of the digit 0, **..** ,9

**Challenge :**

* Wide variability of handwriting .- We can handle it by rules for distinguishing the digits based on shape of the strokes
* Handling rules for distinguishing digits approach can lead to increase of rules and of exceptions to the rules and so on. Thus resulting in poor results.

**Solution :**

* Adopting a machine learning approach
